# Comparing floats in Subspace and stdlib

I am continuing to go through the sus::Iterator methods and turn them all into `constexpr` based on
the performance results from doing so. With `constexpr` an iterator of `chunks_exact()`, and
`take_while()` is able to outperform a "bare-metal" loop over pointers. More on
[that over at Mastodon](https://sunny.garden/@blinkygal/110826776270649927).

As I am doing so, I am writing tests, and this test felt really good to write!

```cpp
static_assert(sus::Vec<f32>::with(2.f, 3.f, 2.f)
    .into_iter()
    .max_by(&f32::total_cmp) == sus::some(3.f));
```

So I interrogated myself why it did. First off, I was happy that you can't write this wrong. You can't call `max()` on floats because they are not strongly ordered. In other words, `operator<=>()` on floats returns `std::partial_ordering`, not `std::strong_ordering`. That means that floats satisfy the `PartialOrd` concept but not the `Ord` concept. And `max()` requires `Ord`.

This is true for `float` as well, but `f32` is nicer to work with for reasons like the `NAN` constant and that `is_nan()` is `constexpr` unlike [`std::isnan()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/isnan) until C++23.

```cpp
// Doesn't compile, as floats are not strongly ordered. Constraint does not match.
// error C7500: 'max': no function satisfied its constraints
sus::Vec<f32>::with(2.f, 3.f, 2.f).into_iter().max();
```
The `f32::total_cmp()` method provides a total ordering over floats and does return `std::strong_ordering`. It does the same thing as [f32::total_cmp in Rust std](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html#method.total_cmp). So we can use it as a callback in `max_by()`.

What does the standard ranges library do when you try to max floats, I wondered. At least on MSVC this is what I got.

```cpp
// Ok sure, looks good.
static_assert(std::ranges::max(
  std::vector<f32>({2.f, 3.f, 2.f})) == 3.f);
// At compile time, NAN is largest.
static_assert(std::ranges::max(
  std::vector<f32>({2.f, 3.f, f32::NAN})).is_nan());
// Unless 3 comes after.
static_assert(std::ranges::max(
  std::vector<f32>({f32::NAN, 3.f, 2.f})) == 3.f);
// At run time, different answers. 3 is largest if it comes first.
EXPECT_EQ(std::ranges::max(
  std::vector<f32>({2.f, 3.f, f32::NAN})), 3.f);
// At run time, NAN is larger if it comes first.
EXPECT_EQ(std::ranges::max(
  std::vector<f32>({f32::NAN, 3.f, 2.f})).is_nan(), true);
// Undefined behaviour!!!
EXPECT_EQ(
  std::ranges::max(std::vector<f32>()), 0.f);
```

Those results are really not okay! They are the kind of thing that doesn't show up in tests and then completely takes down production. Maybe introduces a security vuln.

Here's what I got with Subspace iterators.

```cpp
// Reproducible ordering.
static_assert(sus::Vec<f32>::with(2.f, 3.f, 2.f)
  .into_iter()
  .max_by(&f32::total_cmp) == sus::some(3.f));
static_assert(sus::Vec<f32>::with(2.f, 3.f, f32::NAN)
  .into_iter()
  .max_by(&f32::total_cmp).unwrap().is_nan());
static_assert(sus::Vec<f32>::with(f32::NAN, 3.f, 2.f)
  .into_iter()
  .max_by(&f32::total_cmp).unwrap().is_nan());
// Same thing at runtime as at compile time.
EXPECT_EQ(sus::Vec<f32>::with(2.f, 3.f, f32::NAN)
  .into_iter()
  .max_by(&f32::total_cmp).unwrap().is_nan(), true);
EXPECT_EQ(sus::Vec<f32>::with(f32::NAN, 3.f, 2.f)
  .into_iter()
  .max_by(&f32::total_cmp).unwrap().is_nan(), true);
// Defined behaviour. ^_^b
static_assert(sus::Vec<f32>::with()
  .into_iter()
  .max_by(&f32::total_cmp) == sus::none());
```

Sure you can just write a `total_cmp()` method yourself and use that as the comparator with the standard ranges
library. But you don't have to, it compiles anyway so there's nothing suggesting something is wrong. And then it
returns garbage or corrupts your compilation with Undefined Behaviour.

With Subspace `total_cmp()` is already there for you, and non-sense inputs don't compile.

This stuff is why Rust is pleasant to work in. C++ can be too.
