I am computer scientist and software security engineer at
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/), with an strong interest in
programming languages, APIs, developer education, security and memory safety. While I am excited
about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), there is a lot of C++ in this world. Security-crtical C++
projects have a history of being a risk to their users, so I want to improve how we write C++.

This blog is largely documenting my C++ language research and experience building the
[Subspace library](https://github.com/chromium/subspace) and associated tooling.
