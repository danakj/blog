Software developer at [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/), with an interest in languages,
APIs, developer education, security and memory safety. I am a convert to
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). But there's a lot of C++ in this world and I am trying to figure
out how to improve how we write it.

For now, I'll mostly be blogging about my C++ experiences and wishes in building the
[Subspace library](https://github.com/chromium/subspace) and associated tooling.
