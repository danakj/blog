Software developer at [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/), with an interest in languages, APIs, developer education, security and memory safety. I am a convert to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but there's a lot of C++ in this world. So I am trying to figure out how to fix how we write C++.

For now, I'll mostly be blogging about my C++ experiences and wishes in building the [Subspace library](https://github.com/chromium/subspace) and associated tooling.
